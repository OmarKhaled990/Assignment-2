            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            Over the past few years, I've had the privilege of engaging in enriching professional experiences. At Nokia, during my summer internship from August 2023 to September 2023, I delved into a diverse range of knowledge within the Telecom domain and honed my Machine Learning skills through intensive technical sessions. Collaborating with my team, we successfully executed a final project. Similarly, at Dell Technologies, in the summer of 2022, I completed rigorous courses in Information Storage and Management as well as Cloud Infrastructure Services, gaining hands-on expertise in various fields. Through close collaboration with teams, we successfully delivered a final project. Additionally, my tenure at BambooGeeks from July 2021 to September 2021 significantly enriched my expertise in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This period involved immersive hands-on exercises in Neural Networks and culminated in the successful completion of a comprehensive Deep Learning course.

            <h2>Volunteering</h2>
            I've been actively involved with Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) in various capacities. As a GDSC Mentor, I played a crucial role in aiding the new GDSC lead in community management, providing invaluable guidance, advice, feedback, and support. During my tenure as a GDSC Lead from July 2021 to July 2022, I took on the responsibility of nurturing student developers, empowering them to make meaningful technological impacts in their communities. This involved identifying and collaborating with local partners, leading project-building activities, and organizing hands-on workshops and events to enhance students' proficiency in developed products and platforms. Notably, I managed workshops and sessions, contributing to the training of 1500 students at my campus in the fields of Data Science and Python, ultimately reaching a global audience of 20,000 students. Additionally, as a GDSC Technical Core Team Member from September 2020 to July 2021, I actively supported students in gaining knowledge in the computer science domain, hosting sessions on Python, design thinking, and Google design sprint. Furthermore, I successfully completed Qwiklabs training, further enhancing my technical expertise.
